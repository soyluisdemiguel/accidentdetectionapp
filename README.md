# Accident Detection App

This application is designed to detect accidents in real-time using a combination of hardware sensors and machine learning algorithms. The main components of the application are:

- **Frontend**: A web interface that displays real-time data from the sensors and alerts in case of detected accidents.
- **Backend**: A Python server that processes the sensor data, runs the machine learning models for accident detection, and sends the results to the frontend.

The application is designed to be deployed on a hardware device with the necessary sensors installed. The device sends the sensor data to the backend server, which processes the data and updates the frontend interface in real-time.

The machine learning models used for accident detection are trained on a large dataset of sensor data from various accident scenarios. The models are capable of detecting different types of accidents with high accuracy.

The application also includes a feedback system that allows users to confirm or deny the detected accidents. This feedback is used to continuously improve the accuracy of the machine learning models.

Overall, the Accident Detection App provides a comprehensive solution for real-time accident detection, making it a valuable tool for safety and accident prevention.
